## Overview
During my time at Gamifier, I worked on a memory card game developed to celebrate Saudi Foundation Day with players.
I was responsible for implementing the leaderboard system using PlayFab, enabling real-time score tracking and player rankings. In addition to backend programming, I also handled art integration, adjusting and implementing visual assets to match the gameâ€™s layout and theme. This project combined cultural celebration with engaging gameplay to create a festive and interactive player experience.
