## Overview
Developed a culturally themed memory card game to celebrate Saudi Foundation Day. I implemented the leaderboard system using PlayFab, enabling real-time score tracking and player rankings. In addition to backend integration, I managed the visual asset implementation—adapting and placing artwork to fit the game’s layout and theme. This project blended cultural significance with interactive gameplay, delivering a festive and engaging experience for players.
